# 👋 Assalamu Alaikum! I’m Kareem AbuSharkh  

## **Computer Engineering Student | UAV & Embedded Systems Developer | Physical Design (ASIC) — In Progress**

Welcome to my engineering space 🚀  
I’m a **Computer Engineering student at Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT)** with hands-on experience in **UAV systems, embedded development, and autonomous robotics**, and a growing specialization in the **semiconductor field**, particularly **ASIC physical design and digital hardware implementation**.

My interests sit at the intersection of **real-world systems and silicon-level design**... from building and programming drones to understanding how reliable, high-performance hardware is physically realized.
